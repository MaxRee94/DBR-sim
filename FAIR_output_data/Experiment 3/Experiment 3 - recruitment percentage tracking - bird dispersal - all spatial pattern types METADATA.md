## Experiment description:

In the third experiment, we studied seedling fates under different dispersal modes. We performed two ensembles of 24 simulations each, using bird and wind dispersal, respectively. Simulations had an initial tree cover of 0.50 and randomly varying spatial patterns. Seedling fates (i.e., whether or not a seedling results in a new established tree) were recorded and averaged across runs. In our model, seedlings either die due to excessive shading or competition with other trees or are recruited.

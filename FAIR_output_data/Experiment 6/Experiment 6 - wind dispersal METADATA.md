## Experiment description:

In the sixth experiment, we investigated the extent to which spatial pattern morphology influences forest resilience. We performed two simulation ensembles with 20 runs each, using dispersal by wind or by birds flying at 3 m/s, respectively. Initial spatial patterns contained forest patches of 2×10^5 m^2 on average. We measured tree cover after 200 years across a range \[0.33, 0.67] of initial tree cover levels.

## Experiment description:

Experiment four was designed to investigate the influence of dispersal modes on recruitment rate. We compared the means and variance of recruitment rate between wind-dispersed and bird-dispersed simulation ensembles, and analyzed the effect of forest patch size on these mea sures. In addition, we explored the extent to which bird-dispersed recruitment rate is sensitive to bird behavioral parameters. To this end, bird flight speed was varied between ensembles. Flight speed was used as an indicator of sensitivity to behavioral parameters because prelimi nary tests had revealed that it has the strongest effect on recruitment rate out of all behavioral parameters. To compare mean recruitment rates between forests dispersed by wind and birds with different flight speeds, two bird-dispersed simulation ensembles were run with a flight speed of 3 m/s and 6 m/s respectively, as well as a third ensemble which used wind dispersal. Each ensemble was divided into 5 sets of 50 simulations, and each set was initialized with a different type of pattern; specifically, a uniform distribution of trees, or patches with a mean size of 9 × 103 m2, 3 × 104 m2, 7 × 104 m2, or 2 × 105 m2 (examples are shown in Fig. S1). Initial tree cover was 0.50 across all simulations. We performed a two-tailed T-test to compare mean recruitment rate in ensembles dispersed by wind with that in bird-dispersed simulations with a flight speed of 3 m/s.

All numbers are per year.

## Experiment description:

In the fifth experiment, we investigated the influence of spatial pattern morphology on recruitment rate in the case of bird dispersal and coarse forest patterns with a mean patch size of 2×10^5  m^2. Two bird-dispersed simulation ensembles with a bird flight speed of 3 m/s were run, and initial tree cover was set to 0.50. Both ensembles were subdivided into 20 subsets of 40 simulations each. For all subsets in one of the ensembles, simulations within one and the same subset were initialized with identical forest spatial patterns, although patterns did differ across subsets. In the other ensemble, initial spatial patterns were varied randomly between simulations inside subsets.

All numbers are per year.

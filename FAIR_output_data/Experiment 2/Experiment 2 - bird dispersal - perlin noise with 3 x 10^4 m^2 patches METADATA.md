## Experiment description:

The second experiment was designed to explore to what extent resilience differs between dispersal modes. We varied initial tree cover between 0.38 and 0.52 because preliminary exper iments had established that the model was unstable within roughly this range. Two simulation ensembles with 20 simulations each were run, using dispersal by birds or wind, respectively. Simulations were initialized with spatial patterns containing patches with a mean area of 3 x 10^4 m^2. Tree cover after 200 years was measured, from which our indicator of resilience was derived.
